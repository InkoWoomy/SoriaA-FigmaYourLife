Figma Your Life

This site has some information about me and what I like to do in my life, as well as what I've accomplished so far.

Peer Reviewer: Leo Garcia
Review: I really like the layout of the website, and I see the Figma prototype left itself simple enough to allow more changes, but solid enough to provide a good structure. Some of the alignment could be better, but other than that I like what the website is going for. I also noticed the icon on the tab, super cool.
